Caravel is a template SoC for Efabless Open MPW and chipIgnite shuttles based on the Sky130 node from SkyWater Technologies. The
current SoC architecture is given below.

.. _getting-started:

Caravel Architecture
====================

Caravel is composed of three main sub-blocks: *management area*, *storage area*, and *user project area*.

.. _management-area:

Management Area
--------------

The managment area includes a  `picorv32 <https://github.com/cliffordwolf/picorv32>`__ based SoC that includes a number of periphrals like timers, uart, and gpio. The managemnt area runs firmware that can be used to:

-  Configure User Project I/O pads
-  Observe and control User Project signals (through on-chip logic
   analyzer probes)
-  Control the User Project power supply

For a complete list of the SoC periphrals, check the  `memory map <https://github.com/efabless/caravel/blob/master/verilog/rtl/README>`__

.. _storage-area:

Storage Area
--------------

The storage area is an auxiliary storage space for the managment SoC. It holds two dual port RAM blocks (1KB) generated by
`OpenRAM <https://github.com/VLSIDA/OpenRAM.git>`__

The storage area is only accessible by the management SoC.

.. _user-project-area:

User Project Area
--------------

This is the user space. It has a limited silicon area ``2.92mm x 3.52mm`` as well as a fixed number of I/O pads ``38`` and power pads ``4``.

The user space has access to the following utilities provided by the management SoC:

- ``38`` IO Ports
- ``128`` Logic analyzer probes
- Wishbone port connection to the management SoC wishbone bus.


Quick Start for User Projects
=============================

Your area is the full user space, so feel free to add your
project there or create a differnt macro and harden it seperately then
insert it into the ``user_project_wrapper`` for digital projects or insert it into ``user_project_analog_wrapper`` for analog projects.

.. _digital-user-project:

Digital User Project
--------------------

If you are building a digital project for the user space, check a sample project at  `caravel_user_project <https://github.com/efabless/caravel_user_project>`__.

If you will use OpenLANE to harden your design, go through the instructions in this `README <https://github.com/efabless/caravel/blob/master/openlane/README.rst>`__.

Digital user projects should adhere the following requirements:

- Top module is named ``user_project_wrapper``


- The ``user_project_wrapper`` adheres to the pin order defined at `Digital Wrapper Pin Order <https://github.com/efabless/caravel/blob/master/openlane/user_project_wrapper_empty/pin_order.cfg>`__.


- The ``user_project_wrapper`` adheres to the fixed design configurations at `Digital Wrapper Fixed Configuration <https://github.com/efabless/caravel/blob/master/openlane/user_project_wrapper_empty/fixed_wrapper_cfgs.tcl>`__.


- The user project repository adheres to the `Required Directory Structure <#required-directory-structure>`__.


.. _analog-user-project:

Analog User Project
------------------

If you are building an analog project for the user space, check a sample project at  `caravel_user_project_analog <https://github.com/efabless/caravel_user_project_analog>`__.

Analog user projects should adhere the following requirements:

- Top module is named ``user_analog_project_wrapper``

- The ``user_analog_project_wrapper`` uses the `empty analog wrapper <https://github.com/efabless/caravel/blob/master/mag/user_analog_project_wrapper_empty.mag>`__.

- The ``user_analog_project_wrapper`` adheres to the same pin order and placement of the `empty analog wrapper <https://github.com/efabless/caravel/blob/master/mag/user_analog_project_wrapper_empty.mag>`__.

------

IMPORTANT
^^^^^^^^^

Please make sure to run ``make compress`` before commiting anything to
your repository. Avoid having 2 versions of the
``gds/user_project_wrapper.gds`` one compressed and the
other not compressed.

For information on tooling and versioning, please refer to `tool-versioning.rst <./docs/source/tool-versioning.rst>`__.

-----

Required Directory Structure
============================

-  ``gds/`` : includes all the gds files used or produced from the
   project.
-  ``def`` : includes all the def files used or produced from the
   project.
-  ``lef/`` : includes all the lef files used or produced from the
   project.
-  ``mag/`` : includes all the mag files used or produced from the
   project.
-  ``maglef`` : includes all the maglef files used or produced from the
   project.
-  ``spi/lvs/`` : includes all the spice files used or produced from the
   project.
-  ``verilog/dv`` : includes all the simulation test benches and how to
   run them.
-  ``verilog/gl/`` : includes all the synthesized/elaborated netlists.
-  ``verilog/rtl`` : includes all the Verilog RTLs and source files.
-  ``openlane/<macro>/`` : includes all configuration files used to
   run openlane on your project.
-  ``info.yaml``: includes all the info required in `this
   example <https://github.com/efabless/caravel/blob/master/info.yaml>`__. Please make sure that you are pointing to an
   elaborated caravel netlist as well as a synthesized
   gate-level-netlist for the `user_project_wrapper`


**NOTE:**

    If you're using openlane to harden your design, the ``verilog/gl`` ``def/`` ``lef/`` ``gds/`` ``mag`` ``maglef`` directories should
    be automatically populated by openlane.

Check `mpw-one-final <https://github.com/efabless/caravel/tree/mpw-one-final>`__ for the caravel used for the mpw-one tapeout.

> :warning: You don't need to integrate your design with Caravel GDS for **MPW two**. Running ``make ship`` is no longer required.
