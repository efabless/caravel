      ** CVC COMPILED VERILOG SIMULATOR HELP MESSAGE **
 
  CVC is a compiled Verilog HDL simulator following the 2005 IEEE 1364
  standard with some SystemVerilog features and some modifications to match
  actual behavior of the de facto standard XL simulator.  Modeling in C/C++
  and Verilog using PLI 1, PLI 2, and DPI interfaces is supported.  The PLI
  implementation follows 2005 LRM.  See the release notes for latest 
  problems and changes.
 
  Usage:  cvc [intermixed options and Verilog source files].
 
  Command line and -f command file options must be in lower case and must
  begin with a - or +.  Each option requires a separate - or +.  Type
  'cvc -?' or 'cvc -h' to generate this help message.  To enter the
  Verilog statement interactive debugger assuming the +interp option
  was select to use interpreted simulation: press interrupt (^c) or execute
  $stop, then type :help' for interactive debugger help.
 
  It is assumed that you already know Verilog and have access to a 1364 LRM
  or other Verilog documentation.  CVC supports both PLI (Programming,
  Language Interface) 1 tf_ and acc_ and PLI 2 vpi_ utility, design object,
  and callback routines using +loadpli1= and +loadvpi= dynamic PLI load
  options defined below.  To invoke the PLI from CVC, you may need to 
  compile with the +acc+ access option or set PLI access levels using
  an option control with with the -optconfigfile option. Both old PLI 1 and 
  new PLI 2 libraries can be dynamically loaded during one run.  See 
  examples in examples.vpi examples.tf and examples.acc release directories
  for examples showing how to link and run PLI models. 
 
  CVC supports the SystemVerilog Direct Programming Interface (DPI).  It
  allows a simple interface between C/C++/SystemC and Verilog.  To invoke
  and link a DPI library use the -sv_lib command.  See the release 
  examples.dpi directory and run the tests to see how to code DPI Verilog
  prototypes of DPI functions or tasks and how to link DPI code. The DPI
  interface is documented in any System Verilog LRM Section 35 and Annex I.
 
  CVC generally produces results matching other simulators even when other
  simulators differ from 1364 standard up to differences in event order.
  Compiled CVC produces identical results when used in interpreted (+interp
  option) mode.  However, CVC does not change port direction because of net
  connection direction (i.e. treat nets with wrong side of port drivers as
  inouts) unless the +change_port_type option is selected.  It is suggested
  that you change your designs so port type changing is not needed, but for
  full compatibility with other simulators always run with +change_port_type
  option.  CVC implements pulse (glitch) detection for gates as well as
  paths.  This may cause some simulation result differences.  This more
  stringent pulse analysis is consistent with CVC's intended use as
  accurate gate level simulator.
 
  Since all options are collected before processing, if any options are
  duplicated, the rightmost (last) will be used.  All CVC options are
  listed in this help message.  Any other option will be ignored by CVC
  although it may be scanned and used by a user PLI routine.  All options
  not listed in this help message will have warning 506 emitted for minus
  options and inform 410 for plus options.
 
  The CVC compiler only options are:
 
   +interp  Turn on legacy slow interpreted mode (no assembly code
         generation) instead of using CVC's default flow graph assembly
         language output compiler.
   -o [name of executable].  Rename executable.  To save a compiled 
         executable to a name other than the default 'cvcsim'.  Executable 
         will be given the user defined name.
   +work Use result of OS pwd command for temporary work files.
   +usedir=[parth to directory for temporary work files].  If both +work
         and +usedir options are used, +work is selected with a warn.
   -O    Optimize.  For many designs use of -O will increase simulation 
         speed by up to 30% without much cost in compilation time.  
         There are still some designs for which -O leads to unacceptably
         long compilation time or object output file size.  Users must
         decide whether this option is best on a per design basis.
   -Ogate Optimize gate-level.  Subset of -O optimizations for gate level.
          Use this option instead of -O for large gate-level designs.
          This option increases simulation time of large gate-level designs.
   +unroll_loops.  Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be 
         determined at compile time or upon entry to the loop.  This option
         makes the compiled executable larger, and may or may not make 
         simulation faster. 
   -pipe Compile using a faster but less portable mechanism.  This can 
         speed compile time by up to 2X but may have problems
         on different machine architectures/OSes.
   +exe  Execute.  To compile and immediately execute. This option
         compiles into the default 'cvcsim' and creates another
         process to run it.
   +large Large Model.  Use large compiled model (64-bit only). 
         When compiling large designs (mostly gate-level) you may need 
         to compile with this option.   Use the large model if you 
         experience the following error during compilation: 
 
            'relocation truncated to fit: R_X86_64_32S'
 
   +realwarns Turn on real NaN warnings.  CVC does not check for real NaN  
         calculations by default to increase simulation speed.  This option 
         checks for and warnings about real calculations which produce NaN, 
         such as real divide by zero, $ln(0), etc.
 
   +acc+[level].  Set the PLI access level.  Some PLI implementations
        need certain access levels which have an effect on CVC's 
        performance.  The +acc+ option sets the PLI access for an entire
        design, due to the overhead associated with it using the 
        -optconfigfile to set specific module/net levels may lead to better
        simulation peformance.  The levels can be in the range of 1 to 4:
 
        +acc+1 or +acc
         Enable all PLI capabilities except value change callbacks and
         delay annotation.
        +acc+2
         All features above plus value change callbacks.
        +acc+3
         All features above plus module path delay.
        +acc+4
         All features above plus gate delay annotation.
 
 -optconfigfile [file name].  Use an option control file to set options
        at the module/instance/net level.  This is useful for setting
        options which slow simulation: PLI and code coverage.  The option
        control file takes the following format:
 
        module {module_identifiers} {options};
        instance {module_identifiers_and_hierarchical_names} {options}; 
        tree (depth) {list_of_module_identifiers} {options};
        //comments also allowed
 
        Likewise elements can be excluded using the same structure with
        the keywords: module_exclude/instance_exclude/tree_exclude.
 
        All options and names can be passed a comma seperated list : 
        {option1, option2} or {modname1, modname2}. For tree (depth) any
        integer value can be passed for hierarchy depth, 0 for current
        depth, or -1 for entire instance tree depth.
 
        The following PLI options are supported:
 
        acc_rw           - corresponds to +acc+1 level
        acc_cbk          - corresponds to +acc+2 level
        acc_ann_path_del - corresponds to +acc+3 level
        acc_ann_gate_del - corresponds to +acc+4 level
 
        The following code coverage options are supported:
 
        cover_toggle  - turn on toggle coverage
        cover_stmt    - turn on statement coverage
        cover_event   - turn on event coverage
 
        For example to turn on PLI callbacks just for the 'tb' module use
        the control file line:
 
        module {tb} {acc_cbk};
 
        Or turn on toggle and statement coverage for one instance:
 
        module {tb.i1} {cover_toggle, cover_stmt};
 
        Or turn on toggle coverage for all hierarchy under module DUT 
        except for variable i:
 
        tree (-1) {DUT} {cover_toggle};
        instance_exlcude {DUT.i} {cover_toggle};
 
  Optimization options for both the compiler and the interpreter:
 
   +nbaopt  Some Verilog coding styles always code inter-assignment
         delays (usually 1) for non blocking assigns (NBAs) in RTL.  Such
         delays slow down simulation and are not needed by modern synthesis
         algorithms, but can make debugging easier.  Once your design is
         debugged and you are sure there are no clock cycle problems, use
         this option to significantly speed up simulation.
   +mipdopt  Turn on a less accurate but faster module input port delay
        (MIPD) scheduling algorithm.  MIPD delays will be too short.  This
         option can speed up SDF back annotation accurate delay simulation
         by 25% or more if you know your design's clocking is correct.
         Beware that if your design has path delays that are not used
         because total delays from gates are longer, this option will
         produce incorrect results.  Simulation speed up often comes from
         eliminating the need for same source path selection searching.
 
  Options defined in the IEEE 1364 reference manual are supported and have
  the following effect:
 
   -f [file]  Read options and source file names from [file] until it is
         exhausted at which point continue reading from command line.  May
         be nested.
   -l [file]  By default all output is written to stdout and to log file
         verilog.log.  -l changes to log file [file].  System task
         $log([file]) changes to log file [file] during simulation, $nolog
         turns off log file output.  Added system task $flushlog calls OS
         fflush on log file.  $reset does not reset log file.
   -s    Stop just before starting simulation and enter interactive debugger.
   -i [file]  Read interactive debugger commands from file [file] the first
         time interactive mode is entered (usually with -s but possibly by
         $stop or interrupt signal (^c)).  Nested -i [file] options are
         chained not nested.
   -c    Translate source and all referenced library models only.  Ends just
         before loading the translated model into memory.
   -w    Suppress all warning messages.  See +suppress_warns added option for
         suppression of warnings and informs by message number.
   -d    Dump source that is constructed from internal representation.  All
         parameters are replaced by their constant value in the
         reconstructed source output.  Debugger source listing lists lines
         from source files instead of reconstructing source.
   -d_gen_uline  Dump design from internal source representation.  For
         debugging generates since output can then be rerun to test post
         generated Verilog source. Illegal dots and [] in generated names
         replaced by underscore so output may need to be edited for name
         conflicts. XMRs with generate block components (into generate
         blocks) will not be fixed and must be handed edited.
   -d_gen_esc  Dump design reconstructed source same as -d_gen_uline except
         names with dots or [] from generate will be escaped.  Use if
         replacing with underlines causes syntax errors.
   -q    Quiet mode.  Do not print normal progress messages.  Opposite
         of -q is +verbose that prints even more progress messages than normal.
         -q over-rides the other +verbose tracing options so do not use -q if any
         of +verbose, +sdfverbose, +libverbose, +switchverbose or +dpiverbose are
         selected ortherwise no verbose tracing will be in the log file.
   +mindelays, +typdelays, +maxdelays  Choose either minimum, typical or
         maximum value from any constant (min:typ:max) forms in source.
         Selection is made during input scanning so min:typ:max forms
         become constant numbers at translation time.
   -t    Trace procedural statement execution.  Use -et to trace event
         processing.  In other simulators, -t means both -t and -et.
         $settrace,  $setevtrace, $cleartrace, $clearevtrace to control
         tracing during simulation.
   +libnocell  Ignore `celldefine directives in source and libraries.  This
         should not be used if delay back annotation is used since it will
         probably cause annotation to fail.
   +notimingchecks  After checking for correct syntax, ignore timing checks.
   -u    Ignored.  For all upper case, use an OS filter command to convert
         source to all upper case.
 
  Only default and +librescan library scanning order supported.  By default
  all library files from -v [file] and all directories of library elements
  from -y [directory] are scanned from first to last according to input option
  order.  If unresolved names remain after completion of a pass, the list is
  rescanned from the beginning.  If +librescan option is selected, unresolved
  names are resolved one at a time in order they are first seen.  After a
  name has been resolved, the next name in order is resolved by rescanning
  from the beginning of library list.  Options to control order dependent
  resolution and +libnamehide are not implemented.  Library options are:
 
   -v [file]   Treat [file] as a library containing module and UDP
         definitions.  File is sequentially searched for definitions that
         resolve unresolved names.  Within a -v file, if a name if defined
         before use, it is resolved before moving to next library element.
   -y [directory]  Treat every file in [directory] as a -v library although
         usually each file will only contain one definition.  File name in
         directory along with +libext+ option used to find unresolved name.
   +libext+  In -y directory files, name resolution uses file names.  If
         no +libext+ option is present only files whose name exactly
         matches an unresolved module or primitive will be read.  There can
         be no extension.  Normally, each -y file will contain the
         definition for exactly one element but if more elements are present
         they will be used to resolve other unresolved elements.  Use
         +libext+[extension with dot]+[extension with dot]+...  to cause
         file name extensions to be removed before matching file names to
         unresolved element names.  Only one +libext+ option may appear and
         matching is in order when library extensions do not follow the
         simple .[suffix name] convention.  If all files in -y directories
         end with either .v or .V (a common case), use +libext+.v+.V+
   +librescan  Rescan to beginning of library file and directory list after
         every unresolved name is resolved.  At most one name resolved per
         library pass.
   +libverbose  Emit detailed trace messages giving resolution order and
         reason a particular element was resolved at the particular place.
   +show_canceled_e  Path and gate (1 bit continuous assignments implemented
         as gates) outputs set to X when pulses occur that cause scheduled
         but not matured events to be canceled because second input edge
         occurs before output has changed (switched).  The output
         remains at X until another input edge causes an output change
         because it is unknown if a pulse (glitch) will cause output
         switching.  Some other simulators use a less pessimistic algorithm
         that assumes pulses never cause switching and schedule a change
         from X back to original output value on trailing edge of pulse.  If
         your model will not run, use the +warn_canceled_e instead of this
         option and examine warnings.  CVC does not allow only some
         paths and gates to use pulse X showing using specify section
         directives because X showing does not slow down simulation.
         Normally X from a pulse is shown on leading edge of glitch.  Use
         +pulse_e_style_ondetect to cause X to be shown(driven) when pulse
         detected from input change.  Option is standardized replacement for
         previous +spikes option.
   +noshow_canceled_e  Path and gate outputs not driven (shown) as X when
         pulses occur (second input change earlier than selected delay).
         This is the default (normally it is not needed).  It selects normal
         Verilog inertial delay algorithm where the latest input change
         causes the previously scheduled but unmatured event to be canceled.
   +pulse_e_style_ondetect  If +show_canceled_e option selected, this option
         causes output to be set to X (shown) when the pulse (glitch) is
         detected.  If this option is not selected, output is set to X
         (shown) when the pulse propagates to an output.  This option
         selects a more pessimistic (starting earlier) X region.
   +pulse_e_style_onevent  If +show_canceled_e option selected, this option
         selects the default output setting to X (showing) option that sets
         output to X when glitch propagates to output (leading edge is time
         at which the event scheduled latest matures).  There is no reason
         to use this option since it is default.  Control of X showing for
         individual gates and paths is not supported.
   +warn_canceled_e  Emit warning for every gate (including UDP) or path event
         cancel (inertial cancel and reschedule).  This option may cause
         voluminous output so the $suppress_warns and $allow_warns system
         tasks can be used to select particular time periods when warnings
         are emitted.  This option and +show_canceled_e are unrelated so both
         error messages and x showing (injection) may be enabled.
   +nowarn_canceled_e  Because this option is the default it is never needed
         Last of all +warn_canceled_e and +nowarn_canceled_e is used.
 
  The following two options for dynamically loading user PLI libraries are
  not explicitly defined in IEEE 1364 reference manual but are supported:
 
   +loadpli1=[.so library]:[boostrap routines]  Load [.so library] dynamic
         library containing user PLI 1 model and execute each bootstrap
         routine.  [bootstrap routines] is a comma separated list of C
         routines.  List may be empty but : is still required.  No spaces
         are allowed around the equal sign, the colon or commas separating
         bootstrap C routine names.  All dynamic libraries defined by
         +loadpli1= options are first loaded using OS dlopen mechanism and
         then all bootstrap routines are executed before elaboration begins.
         The OS specific dynamic library suffix (.so on Linux) may be
         omitted.  If omitted and the [.so library] is not found in any
         LD_LIBRARY_PATH directory, the dynamic library suffix is added and
         the LD_LIBRARY_PATH directories are searched again.
 
         Each [bootstrap routines] list routine must return a pointer to a
         s_tfcell veriusertfs table that ends with zero value type field.
         Multiple +loadpli1= options are allowed and just before elaboration
         all [bootstrap routines] for every +loadpli1= option are executed.
         Each s_tfcell returned table is added to one design wide master
         s_tfcell table in option and routine in list order.  The master
         table defines all PLI 1 system functions and tasks used during a
         simulation run.  The [bootstrap routines] must not call any PLI
         routines.  Any C file containing [bootstrap routines] list must
         include both veriuser.h and cv_veriuser.h files.  Some OS shells
         may require quoting and escaping option separators and file names
         within the +loadpli1= option string.  Problem can be avoided by
         coding +loadpli1= option in a -f command argument file. See release
         examples.tf directory in tests_and_examples directory for example
         PLI 1 programs and make files specific to your operating system.
   +loadvpi=[.so library]:[boostrap routines]  Load [.so library] dynamic
         library containing user PLI 2 vpi model and execute each bootstrap
         routine.  [bootstrap routines] is a comma separated list of C/C++
         routines.  List may be empty but : is still required.  No spaces
         are allowed around the equal sign, the colon or commas separating
         bootstrap C routine names.  All dynamic libraries defined by
         +loadvpi= options are first loaded using OS dlopen mechanism and
         then all bootstrap routines are executed before elaboration begins.
         The OS specific dynamic library suffix (.so on Linux) may be
         omitted.  If omitted and the [.so library] is not found in any
         LD_LIBRARY_PATH directory, the dynamic library suffix is added and
         the LD_LIBRARY_PATH directories are searched again.
 
         Each [bootstrap routines] is saved on an ordered list and executed
         in order before elaboration begins.  Normally [bootstrap routines]
         will execute routines in vlog_startup_routines table, but any PLI 2
         vpi routines callable before elaboration may be called including
         vpi_register_systf and vpi_register_cb PLI 2 routines.  Some OS
         shells may require quoting and escaping option separators and file
         names within the +loadvpi= option string.  Problem can be avoided by
         coding +loadvpi= option in a -f command argument file. See release
         examples.vpi directory for example PLI 1 programs and make files
         specific to your operating system.
 
   +verbose  Print various simulation progress messages and design component
         counts.  Memory sizes do not count memory used by udp tables.
   +maxerrors [number]  Normally translation terminates after 32
         errors.  Use this option to change the number. 0 means no limit.
         Option applies to translation only, simulation is never stopped.
   -e    Turn off printing of non fatal error messages.
   -informs  Turn on printing of informatory messages.  Off by default.
         Informs may be emitted during translation and during simulation.
         Enable this option to determine if a plus option is misspelled and
         to cause OS error message description strings to be printed.
         Option will probably produce voluminous output unless
         +suppress_warns+[+ separated list] option(s) also used.
   -et   Turn on event tracing.  Option is similar to the -t (or $settrace)
         option but -t only traces procedural execution.  To dynamically
         control event tracing use $setevtrace and $clearevtrace system
         tasks.  Option produces voluminous output. Use -t and -et to
         duplicate other simulator -t tracing.
   +tracefile [name]  Set the output file for any trace output (either
         statement or event).  Use $settracefile system task to change
         trace file during execution.  Name can be stdout and if no option
         or $tracefile, defaults to stdout and log file.  $flushlog system
         task flushes this file during simulation.
   +printstats  Print tables of design contents.  Primitives, instances,
         and wires that will use silicon area are tabulated.  More
         detailed alternative to $showallinstances.
   +printallstats  Option equivalent to +printstats but additionally prints
         the declarative content of every module.
   +suppress_warns+  Individual warning and informatory messages can be
         suppressed (not errors) by including a + separated list. i.e.
         +suppress_warns+403+502+507+564+.  All such options are combined.
         The $suppress_warns([comma separated list]) and $allow_warns
         system tasks can be used during simulation for the same effect.
   +remove_gate_0delays  Change all gates with #0 or #(0, 0, 0) delay to no
         delay (1 bit continuous assigns implemented as gates).  Option can
         significantly speed up simulation but in very rare situation cause
         simulation to fail (#0 delays used to mask races).  If you see a
         large simulation speed up from option, you can probably speed up
         simulation even more by recoding most common cells as udps.  Option
         needed because some simulators only allow delay annotation if gate
         has a delay coded in source.
   +nokeepcommands  Do not save interactive commands to history list.  By
         default,  Interactive commands are saved to history list.  The
         $keepcommands; and $nokeepcommands; system tasks enable and disable
         saving of of history during simulation.  Option should be used when
         interactive input comes from $input or from shell pipe to stdin.
   +define+[symbol] or +define+[symbol]=[string]   Define back quote macro
         symbol [symbol] with an empty text string (first form) for use with
         `ifdef and `ifndef macro facility.  [symbol] does not include back
         quote.  Second form defines symbol with value [string].  [String]
         must not contain white space but can contain anything else including
         surrounding quotes.  Escaped surrounding quotes are converted to
         normal quotes while non escaped will probably be removed
         by your shell.  The $scan$plusargs system task is an alternative
         for setting preprocessor values into variables.
   +incdir+[path]+[path]+...+  Define paths that are searched for `include
         files when `include file not found in current directory.  Only
         `include files that are non absolute paths (not staring with '/'
         or '.' or '..' or '~') are searched for using +incdir paths.
         Paths that do not end with '/' have a '/' path separator appended
         to end.  For file included in different directory, files included
         from it are still searched for in original (not include file)
         directory.  Multiple +incdir+ options may be specified.  Paths
         directories are searched in order of +incdir+ options.
   +sdf_log_file [file]  File is used for SDF annotation instead of default
         writing of SDF messages and errors to Verilog log file.
   +sdf_annotate [file] or +sdf_annotate [file]+[scope reference]  File must
         be in IEEE P1497 standard delay file format.  File is read and used
         to set delay and specify values.  +mindelays, +typdelays or
         +maxdelays setting used to select rtriple value.  Multiple
         +sdf_annotate options (and files) allowed.  If +[scope reference]
         provided, SDF path references relative to scope.  Otherwise, SDF
         paths rooted (context is entire design).  Annotation files processed
         in option order.  Alternatively, $sdf_annotate system task can be
         used to annotate delays.  See systsks.1 man page for documentation.
         Large designs that require large SDF files load somewhat faster if
         command line option instead of system task is used.
   +sdf_during_sim  Option added to support new flow graph compiler.  This
         option should not be used unless your $sdf_annotate system tasks
         require variable arguments or need to run after time 0.  Such
         $sdf_annotate calls result in syntax errors if new compiler is
         used.
   +sdfverbose  Emit trace messages giving new delay value for every delay
         changed during +sdf_annotate delay annotation.  Option can generate
         voluminous output.
   +ignore_sdf_iopath_edges  Normally when SDF (IOPATHs are matched to
         Verilog specify paths for annotating delays, if the SDF (IOPATH
         has a (POSEDGE or (NEGEDGE keyword, only specify paths with the
         same edge will match.  This option causes matching to ignore SDF
         edges.   If this option is selected, (IOPATHs with edges match
         specify paths with or without edges.  Option is needed to agree
         with some simulators annotations.
   +sdf_noerrors  Do not emit SDF annotation error messages.  SDF errors do
         not stop simulation but cause SDF object delay setting to be skipped
         so +maxerrors error limit does not apply.  Use this option to turn
         off printing of SDF error messages.
   +sdf_nowarns  Do not emit warning messages during SDF annotation.  SDF
         warnings and informs can also be suppressed by message number
         using +suppress_warns+ option.
   +switchverbose  Emit trace and size messages for inout and tran gate
         switch channels elaboration. Use this option to print progress
         messages when simulating models with very large switch channels.
   +change_port_type  Some designs require ports that are not declared as
         inout but are connected as inouts and require bidirectional signal
         flow for correct simulation have their port type changes to inout.
         Use this option to cause port direction to be changed to inout for
         input ports with loconn drivers and for output ports with highconn
         drivers.  WARNING: Use of this option may be required to match
         results of other simulators that use port collapsing algorithm.
   +sched_always_first  Change so all always blocks are scheduled (usually
         event control armed) before any initial blocks are scheduled.
         This change makes sure that all time 0 non symthesizable usually
         test bench initial block assignments will trigger always blocks.
         If this option is not selected, some always blocks may not triggger
         until the next signal (usually clock) change.  It is an option
         because some bug reports say that scheduling always blocks first
         causes extra time 0 edges.
   +nospecify  Simulation run with specify section ignored.  This option
         causes specify section to be read and parsed but it is discarded
         before simulation.  +nospecify of course implies +notimingchecks.
   +nointeractive  Option turns off interactive environment, interrupt signal
         (^c) causes immediate termination.  $stop causes a warning to be
         printed without stopping.  Suppress warning 560 to silently ignore
         stops.  If machine code simulation option +compiled_sim is selected,
          this option is automatically turned on.
   +snapshot  If +nointeractive option is selected, if interrupt signal
         (^c) is generated, this option causes a port mortem activity
         snapshot to be printed before program termination.  Debugger
         :where and $snapshot system task produces same output without
         ending simulation.
   +2state  Two state execution.  This optimization may increase compiled
         simulation performance by simulating in 2-state mode.  All
         variables are initialized to 0 and simulated using only 0/1 values,
         x/z values will be converted to 0.  Simulating in 2-state mode
         may increase performance up to 50% without having to change the 
         design itself.
   +2state_no_wires  Two state execution.  Same as +2state except wires
         remain initialized and simulated using 4-state values.  This 
         allows existing designs that depend on 4-state wire values to 
         simulate as expected and initialize from the x/z state.
   +random    Turn on random initialization.  Will initialize variables to
              4-state random values (0/1/X/Z) for 4-state variables and
              1/0 for 2-state variables.  These can be used to find startup
              state initialization bugs.  Also used along with +2state
              option to trigger initialization setup.
   +random_2state    Initialize all variables (inlcuding 4-state) to
              have no X/Z values only 2-state 1/0 values.
   +random=[seed] Turn on random initialization with seed value.  Seed must
              be an integer value.  The random seed can be used to alter
              random initialization values across simulations.
   +random_2state=[seed]  Same as +random, but only initialize all values
              to 2-state 0/1 using the seed to alter intialized values.
   +dumpvars  Dumpvars.  VCD dumpvars for all variables in a design.
   +fstvars   FST dumping.  FST (GTKWave format) value dumping for all
              variables in a design.
   +fstvars_repack  FST dumping.  Do FST value dumping for all variables in
              a design repacking on simulation finish.  Results in smaller
              file but takes a bit longer to repack FST file.
   +fst+parallel=on  Turn on parallel FST dumping.  This can result in
              50% less simulation time when used on multi-core systems.
              We strongly recommend using parallel mode then dumping FST.
              Alternatively can be turned on by setting the CVC_FST_PARALLEL
              environment variable.
   +fst+parallel2=on  Turn on parallel FST dumping - mode 2.  Same as
              +fst+parallel plus uses an additional thread (core) and memory
              to further increase FST dumping performance.  This mode
              will use up to 3 simultaneous cores so should only be ran on
              systems with at least 4 cores (quad-core).  Alternatively
              can be turned on by setting the CVC_FST_PARALLEL2 environment
              variable.
   +dump2fst  Convert all $dump* [VCD] system calls to $fst* [FST] format.
   +dump_arrays Any array form allowed in a $dumpvars statement: entire
              arrays or selects of one array cell.  The various instance
              and all forms for $dumpvars arguments will dump all arrays
              in the instances (or subtree).  This may result in large dump
              files for large arrays which will slow down simulation.
   +dump_array_cells - Only allow dumping of specific array elements in a
              $dumpvars statement.  Each element must be passed as an
              argument to $dumpvars.  This allows dumping of just the 
              desired array elements - not the entire array.
 
 
  The following options are used for built in toggle coverage:
 
   -toggle  Turn on toggle coverage for an entire design and create a 
            coverage report to a file named 'cvc.toggle' by default.
            If option is used, -optconfig with the cover_toggle statement
            can only be used with exclude commands to exclude nets from
            toggle coverage.
 
            There are 4 new system task for finer grained control of toggle
            recording probably for use with -optconfigfile toggle coverage
            reporting option for only a few nets.  Place the system tasks in
            your test bench.  System tasks are: $toggle_state_reset that
            marks all nets for which toggle reporting is on to untoggled.
            Plus $toggle_record_off_set_old_val_x to turn off toggle
            recording and set all old values to X so 2 toggles are needed
            before a net is set to toggled, and $toggle_record_off that
            just turns off toggle recording but leaves the old value
            unchanged so next change will set the net to toggled.
   -toggle_file [file name]  Turn on toggle coverage and print report
            to a specific file.
   -mark_driven_const_wires_toggled  New option that marks all wire bits
            driven either directly by one constant driver or through a
            chain of constant drivers.  All bit driven by constants are
            changed to toggled just before reports are generated or
            the .tgldat file is written.  New -driven_const_report_concise
            prints a per instance and per bit report of driven by constants
            wires that have toggle coverage turned on (i.e. not turned off
            by a -optconfigfile statement). If a section of a design or
            nets are excluded from toggle coverage they can never be
            seen as driven to a constant even if they really are.
   -write_toggle_data  Write .tgldat file of records toggle rooted paths
            from one run.  New simplified ascii format to replace old .tvcd
            output file.  Use the -init_toggle_from file [file name] option
            to read one or more .tgldat written at the end of previous
            -toggle record runs.  Unless the -write_toggle_data_file is
            used to change the file name it defaults to 'verilog.tgldat'
            Change needed because Verilog design must be read in order to
            generate toggle concise uncovered report.  To generate a report
            from a previously crated .tgldat file, use the -c compile only
            option.
   -write_toggle_data_file [file name]  Changes name of output recorded
            toggle data file from default 'verilog.tgldat' to [file name].
            Option also selects -write_toggle_data to write output recorded
            .tgldat file.
   -set_toggled_from_file [file name]  Reads [file name] which must be in
            .tgldat ascii toggle 0->1 and 1->0 format and marks bits as
            toggled if value is 1 in list before simulation begins.
            Multipile -set_toggled_from_file option are allowed.  Toggled
            bits from each file cumulatively set pre simulation toggled
            state. This option in conjunction with the -s and -i and +interp
            options replace old tvcdmerge and tvcdreport programs.  Release
            coverage/src directory contains programs to check .tgldat files
            and to convert from old .tvcd format to new .tgldat format.
           .tgldat files can be concatenated by simply using OS cat command.
 
  For setting toggle coverage for a specific module/instance/net use the
  -optconfigfile option with 'cover_toggle' statement properites.
 
  The following options are used to select the style of the coverage report:
 
   -untoggled_report_concise  New option that only prints untoggled bits
            in as concise a form as possible with minimal coverage
            statistics.  If this option is selected these older toggle
            report options are ignored.  For toggle coverage use this option
            because the older toggle reporting will be removed in the
            future.  Notice that toggling needs to be turned on with the
            -toggle option or with +optconfigfile cover_toggle statement.
   -driven_const_report_concise  Output a report per instance and per bit
            of wires directly driven by one constant driver or through a
            a chain of wires driven by one constant driver.  Report will
            not be written unless the -mark_driven_const_wires_toggled
            option is slected.  Option causes older toggle report options
            to be ignored.
   -ti      Display toggle coverage information per instance.
   -tu      Display uncovered nets - those without 100%% coverage.
   -tc      Display covered nets - those getting 100%% coverage.
   -tb      Display toggle coverage vectors per bit.
 
  The following options are used for statement coverage reporting:
 
   -stmt_coverage  Turn on statement coverage for an entire design and
            create a report to a file named 'cvc.stmts' by default.
   -stmt_coverage_file [file name]  Turn on statement coverage and
            print to a specific file.
   -stmt_tasks  Include task/function statements for coverage.
 
  For setting statement coverage for a specific module use the
  -optconfigfile option with 'cover_stmt'.
 
  The following options are used for @ event coverage reporting:
 
   -event_coverage  Turn on @ event coverage for an entire design and
            create a report to a file named 'cvc.events' by default.
   -event_coverage_file [file name]  Turn on event coverage and
            print to a specific file.
 
  For setting event coverage for a specific module use the -optconfigfile
  option with 'cover_event'.
 
  The following options are used for X-propagation:
 
   +xprop   Turn on X-propagation.  This turns on advanced CVC
            X-propagation feature which helps locate and resolve possible
            bugs due to Xs in the design.
   +xprop2  Turn on X-propagation style 2.  This turns on advanced CVC
            X-propagation which helps locate and remove Xs all together 
            from the design.
   +xtrace  Turn on X-propagation tracing for all conditions which
            trigger X-propagation.  All tracing is placed into a 
            text file with default name 'cvc.xprop'.
   +xtrace_suppress  Suppress X-propagation tracing until later turned on
            at a specific simulation time using the $xtraceon system call.
            Using +xtrace_suppress along with $xtraceon to turn on 
            X-propagation tracing for a certain simulation time block.
   +xtracemax=[number]  Set the maximum number of trace statements to 
              record.  This is used along with +xtrace to avoid 
              creating large 'cvc.xprop' files during simulation.  If not
              used the default 1000 statements will be written. Set
              +tracemax=0 to turn the limit off.
   +xprop_eval Turn on much more pessimistic algorithsm for RTL binary 
               and unary reducing  |, & type operators.
   +xprop_exclude Dump a file called 'cvc.xprop.exlcuded' which reports
                  all statements which are not included in X-propagation
                  giving the reason why for each statement.
   +no_xedges   Do not include always @(x) X edge detection for X-propagation.
   +no_vector_xedges Do not include always @(x) X edge detection for 
                  variables greater than one bit (only scalars).
   +only_pos_neg_xedges  Only include always @(posedge/negedge).  Regular
                  @(var) without posedge/negedge will not be included
                  in X-propagation X detection.
 
  For setting xprop settings for specific modules use the -optconfigfile
  option with 'xprop'/'xprop2'/'xprop_eval'.
 
 For a complete explanation of X-propagation see 'cvc_propagation.pdf' in 
 the release directory.
 
  The following options are for use with SystemVerilog features:
 
   -sv  Parse source files for SystemVerilog using SystemVerilog keywords.
        For currently supported SystemVerilog feaures see the docs/
        directory from the top level of the release directory.
   -sverilog  Same as -sv.
   -sv_lib [.so library]  Load a dynamic DPI library.  Link in the 
        precompiled library of DPI user defined functions.  CVC will assume
        SystemVerliog parsing (-sv) if supplied a library with -sv_lib.
        Since most Verilog simulations use relative paths from the sim
        directory cvc runs in, if [.so library] for finding dpi_ import
        c procs name does not start with slash for rooted path or './' for
        relative, the './' is prepended to the .so library name.  See the
        release examples.dpi directory for examples that use this option.
        If you have problems loading dpi_ import .so libraries, use the
        +dpiverbose option to find out why a library was not found.
   +dpiverbose  Emit tracing messages for each +import foreign dpi_ c proc
        showing which library is is linked from.  Also turns on -sv_lib
        consistency checking.
   +write_dpi_hdrs  For designs that use the DPI interface, use this option
        to have CVC write an example C language header file (dpi_hdrs.h)
        containing prototypes DPI import and export prototypes.  Option
        is useful for determining SystemVerilog types from import and
        export declarations.
